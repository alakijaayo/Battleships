# Battleships

Based on a [tech test](https://github.com/alakijaayo/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-8/battleships) that is available at Makers, the aim of this project is to build a game of battleship that works when run in Terminal. Unlike the tech test that is done using Ruby, I am going to try my hand at building it in JavaScript/Node.JS, using Mocha and Chai for testing.
